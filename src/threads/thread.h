/* A kernel thread or user process.

   Each thread structure is stored in its own 4 kB page.  The
   thread structure itself sits at the very bottom of the page
   (at offset 0).  The rest of the page is reserved for the
   thread's kernel stack, which grows downward from the top of
   the page (at offset 4 kB).  Here's an illustration:

        4 kB +---------------------------------+
             |          kernel stack           |
             |                |                |
             |                |                |
             |                V                |
             |         grows downward          |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             +---------------------------------+
             |              magic              |
             |                :                |
             |                :                |
             |               name              |
             |              status             |
        0 kB +---------------------------------+

   The upshot of this is twofold:

      1. First, `struct thread' must not be allowed to grow too
         big.  If it does, then there will not be enough room for
         the kernel stack.  Our base `struct thread' is only a
         few bytes in size.  It probably should stay well under 1
         kB.

      2. Second, kernel stacks must not be allowed to grow too
         large.  If a stack overflows, it will corrupt the thread
         state.  Thus, kernel functions should not allocate large
         structures or arrays as non-static local variables.  Use
         dynamic allocation with malloc() or palloc_get_page()
         instead.

   The first symptom of either of these problems will probably be
   an assertion failure in thread_current(), which checks that
   the `magic' member of the running thread's `struct thread' is
   set to THREAD_MAGIC.  Stack overflow will normally change this
   value, triggering the assertion. */
/* The `elem` member has a triple purpose. It can be an element in the
   run queue (thread.c), an element in the sleeping queue (thread.c), or
   an element in the semaphore wait list (synch.c). It can be used these
   three ways only because they are mutually exclusive:
      -  Only a thread in the ready state is on the run queue
      -  Only a thread in the blocked state can be in the sleeping queue 
         or semaphore wait list, and those two are mutually exclusive:
         +  A thread already in the sleeping queue will not execute any 
            further calls until it wakes up (removed from sleeping queue.)
            This includes any `sema_down` calls which add said thread to
            its semaphore wait list.
         +  A thread already in a semaphore wait list will not execute any 
            further calls until it is woken up (removed from semaphore's 
            wait list.) This includes any `thread_sleep` calls which add
            said thread to the thread sleeping queue.
         +  A thread in neither the sleeping queue nor the semaphore wait
            list will execute further calls until either a `thread_sleep`
            or `sema_down` call, which will put the thread into the to 
            states described above, respectively, meaning `elem` will never
            be added to both of those simultaneously.
